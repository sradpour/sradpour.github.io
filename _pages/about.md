I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Stockton University,s School of Social and Behavioral Sciences. Previously, I held the position of  Associate Research Director at the Retirement Equity Lab at the New School for Social Research (NSSR). I study the political economy of aging. Specifically, I am interested in how the aging of the U.S. population is changing the labor market, the retirement system, and how we redistribute economic resources based on age, gender, race and ethnicity, and class. My research focuses on the effects of the retirement system on wealth and income inequality, wellbeing, and economic growth and redistribution. I am also interested in the economics of climate change and what policies can help us effectively mitigate its consequences. 

I earned my PhD in economics from the New School for Social Research (NSSR), my MA in international economics and business from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and Corvinus University of Budapest, and my BSc in industrial engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology.
