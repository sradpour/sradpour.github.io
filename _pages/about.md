I am an economist studying political economy of aging - how living longer and the aging of the U.S. population is changing the labor market, the retirement system, and how we redistribute economic resources based on peoples age, gender, race and ethnicity, and class. My research focuses on the effects of the retirement system on wealth and income inequality, wellbeing, and economic growth and redistribution. I am also interested in economics of cliamate change and what policies can help us effectively  

I earned my PhD in economics in 2020 from the New School for Social Research, where I also worked as a Research Associate for the Retirement Equity Lab before accepting my current role as the Associate Director of Research. I received my MA in international economics and business from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and Corvinus University of Budapes, and my BSc in industrial engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology.
